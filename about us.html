      <h1>Father Of Origami</h1><img src="./Akira_Yoshizawa.jpg" alt="">
      <br>
      <p>Akira Yoshizawa was a Japanese origamist, considered to be the grandmaster of origami. He is widely recognized
        for his work in raising origami from a craft to a living art form. Yoshizawa devised many new folding techniques
        during his lifetime. According to his own estimation made in 1989, he created more than 50,000 models, of which
        only a few hundred designs were presented as diagrams in his 18 books. Yoshizawa acted as an international
        cultural ambassador for Japan throughout his career. In 1983, Japanese emperor Hirohito named him to the Order
        of the Rising Sun, one of the highest honors that can be given to a Japanese citizen. <a href="./read more.html"

      <h2> About Origami</h2>
      <h3>What Is Origami?</h3>
      <p>
        Origami is the Japanese art of paper folding, combining simplicity and precision to transform a flat square of
        paper into shapes with volume, form, and meaning. The word “origami” comes from ori (folding) and kami (paper).
        Unlike crafts that use cutting or glue, traditional origami relies purely on folding techniques. Its simplicity
        masks the complexity and beauty possible within each fold.</p>

      <h2> A Brief History of Origami </h2>
      <p>
        Origami started as a ceremonial craft in East Asia—used in religious rituals, gift-giving, and cultural customs.
        As paper technology and availability improved, origami moved beyond ritual into everyday life and artistic
        expression. One of the earliest formal instructions appears in books like Senbazuru Orikata (late 18th century),
        which popularized models like the paper crane.</p> <a href="./more.html" class="learn-more-btn">Learn More</a>
